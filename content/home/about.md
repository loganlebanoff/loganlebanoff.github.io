# Biography

Hi! My name is Logan Lebanoff and I am an Artificial Intelligence Engineer at [SoarTech](https://soartech.com/) in Orlando, FL. I have a Ph.D. in Computer Science and nine years of experience in AI research and industry. Passionate about bleeding-edge research and pushing the frontier of AI, I specialize in large language models (LLMs) and have led multiple AI projects to successful outcomes. I've published over 15 research papers including top NLP conferences like ACL, EMNLP, and NAACL.

I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Central Florida. My research interests include Large Language Models, Natural Language Processing, and Deep Learning. I performed research under the advisement of [Dr. Fei Liu](https://www.cs.emory.edu/~fliu40/) in the UCF NLP group. My Ph.D. research focused on abstractive summarization of news articles using sentence selection and fusion.
