# Biography

Hi! My name is Logan Lebanoff and I am an Artificial Intelligence Engineer at SoarTech in Orlando, FL. I help create NLP and deep learning solutions to the militaryâ€™s toughest problems. I am deeply interested in cutting-edge natural language processing and deep learning research. 

I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Central Florida. My research interests include Natural Language Processing, Automatic Text Summarization, and Deep Learning. I performed research under the advisement of [Dr. Fei Liu](http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~feiliu/) in the [UCF NLP group](http://www.nlp.cs.ucf.edu/).

My Ph.D. research focused on abstractive summarization of news articles. More specifically, I worked on sentence fusion in summarization. Current abstractive summarizers often perform well at taking important sentences from the document and compressing each sentence. However, they still struggle with fusing multiple sentences together in a coherent manner, and they often generate incorrect facts. In my dissertation, I presented several methods to improve sentence fusion.
