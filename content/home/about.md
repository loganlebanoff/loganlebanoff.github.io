# Biography

Hi! My name is Logan Lebanoff and I am a 4th-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Central Florida. My research interests include Natural Language Processing, Automatic Text Summarization, and Deep Learning. I am currently under the advisement of [Dr. Fei Liu](http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~feiliu/) in the [UCF NLP group](http://www.nlp.cs.ucf.edu/).

My current research is on abstractive summarization of news articles. More specifically, I am working on sentence fusion in summarization. Current abstractive summarizers often perform well at taking important sentences from the document and compressing each sentence. However, they still struggle with fusing multiple sentences together in a coherent
manner, and they often generate incorrect facts. I am working on methods to improve sentence fusion.
